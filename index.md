# MongoDB - Performance
- RAM plays an important part of MongoDB optimization. It is 25 times faster than SSDs.
- RAM is crucial for carrying out the following operations
1. Aggregation
2. Index Traversing
3. Write Operations
4. Query Engine
5. Connections (1MB)

** By default, MongoDB tries to use all the available CPU cores to respond to incoming CPU requests. In short, the better the CPU, the faster is the MongoDB.
1. Page Compression
2. Data Calculation
3. Aggregation Framework  Operations
4. Map Reduce requires the availability of CPU cycles.

## The types of disks(IOPS) also greatly affect the performance.
